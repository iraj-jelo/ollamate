### Q/A

#### I'm getting ImportError or ModuleNotFoundError errors.

The errors:
```
ImportError: No module named 'tkinter'
```
or 
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter' in Python
```

These happen due to lack of the Tk library on your machine: 

For **Ubuntu**:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

For **Fedora**:

```
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

For **macOS**:

```
brew install python-tk
```
